There is a lot of development going on right now.  I would love help if you're interested.  Contact me on irc [ax in #lad on freenode] or via email [alex at x37v.info]


For beat analysis you need the queen mary vamp plugins: http://vamp-plugins.org/plugin-doc/qm-vamp-plugins.html

vamp ubuntu:
headers are in vamp-plugin-sdk
you'll also want libvamp-hostsdk3 installed

osx:
vamp libaray binaries are included
