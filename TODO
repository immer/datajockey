Beat Extraction:
   Smooth
   Extract Tempo Descriptors
Importer:
   Provide any sort of UI?  At least list the tracks before importing? Display progress.
   GUI importer, integrate into main app
Works:
   Better sorting.. field hiding and reorder?  Save field settings?
   Filter views
License:
   Figure out all that we have to display.  Attribution in the GUI?  What about command line?
Tags:
  Relationships between tags and songs have type [genre, theme, etc].
    How to differentiate 'metal' the material with 'metal' the genre?  postfix all genre's with 'music'?
    'metal music', 'house music' ?
    'speed' is a slang drug term.. how to differentiate?
      Maybe tags should allow for duplicates? 'metal' the genre and 'metal' the material?
      speed is a slang term for methamphetamine which is type of drug, a different speed is a scalar of distance over time
  Tag -> Tag relationships:
    computers and radios are types of electronic devices
    love, anger, fear are types of emotions
    'Computer Love' by Kraftwerk has lyrical theme tags: love, computer
      selecting 'electronic devices' and 'emotions' for lyrical themes, when allowing for children in filters, would include 'Computer Love'

Track Selections [playlists].
  Groupings of tracks, can be ordered..
  Baby Rave
  Dark Mix
  Emily's 2nd Electro mix..
  etc.
  Why not use tags??
