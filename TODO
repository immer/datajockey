collapse audio_file and annotation file into work.. 

Also put primary artist in there.. later down the line we could create an 'additional artist' relationship table that would map artist ---[type]---> work where type could be 'original artist' for a remix or cover, producer, etc. etc.

Work:
  title
  ..
  artist_id
  audio_file_location
  audio_file_type_id
  audio_file_milliseconds
  audio_file_channels
  annotation_file_location
